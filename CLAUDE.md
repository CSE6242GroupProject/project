# Product Requirements Document for Cancer Rate Visualization App

## Overview

This web application is a single-page app that visualizes predicted cancer rates due to pesticide exposure across U.S. counties using an interactive chloropleth map. The map is segmented by county, with each segmentâ€™s color intensity reflecting the predicted cancer rate. Users can filter the map by year and cancer type to explore trends and patterns in the data. Developed for a course on Data Visualizations and Analytics, the application leverages modern web technologies to deliver an effective data visualization experience.

## Functional Requirements

- **Chloropleth Map:** Display a map of the United States segmented by counties, with each county colored according to the predicted cancer rate due to pesticide exposure.
- **Color Scale:** Implement a sequential color scale where higher predicted cancer rates correspond to darker colors.
- **Filters:** Provide interactive controls for users to select a specific year and cancer type.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Update the map visualization in real-time when users apply or change filters, without requiring a page reload.
- **Data Integration:** Load and process data from a CSV file containing the following columns:
  - `year`
  - `state_fips_code`
  - `county_fips_code`
  - `cancer_type`
  - `predictions`
- **Data Mapping:** Use state and county FIPS codes to accurately associate prediction data with the corresponding counties on the map.
- **Dynamic Filters:** Automatically populate filter options (years and cancer types) based on the unique values present in the CSV data.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the application loads quickly and responds smoothly to user interactions, even with large datasets.
- **Usability:** Design an intuitive interface that allows users to easily interact with the map and filters.
- **Accessibility:** Make the application usable across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Code Quality:** Maintain clean, modular, and well-documented code to facilitate collaboration and future maintenance.

## User Interface Requirements

- **Single-Page Application:** Deliver all functionality within a single web page.
- **Map Display:** Position the chloropleth map as the primary visual element, occupying the majority of the screen.
- **Filter Controls:** Include user-friendly widgets (e.g., dropdown menus) for selecting year and cancer type, placed prominently near the map.
- **Legend:** Display a color legend to explain the mapping between color intensity and predicted cancer rates.
- **Optional Tooltips:** (If time permits) Show the county name and exact prediction value when users hover over a county.

## Data Requirements

- **Data Source:** Utilize a CSV file as the primary data source, with columns: `year`, `state_fips_code`, `county_fips_code`, `cancer_type`, `predictions`.
- **Data Processing:** Parse the CSV file and convert its contents into JSON objects for use within the application.
- **Data Filtering:** Filter and aggregate the data dynamically based on the user-selected year and cancer type.
- **Geographic Data:** Incorporate TopoJSON data representing U.S. county boundaries to render the chloropleth map.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** Svelte 5 and SvelteKit 2 for building the single-page application.
- **Visualization Library:** D3.js for rendering the chloropleth map and handling data-driven visualizations.
- **Geographic Data Handling:** topojson-client to process and integrate TopoJSON geographic data.
- **Styling:** Tailwind v4 for responsive and efficient CSS styling.
- **Data Format:** JSON objects, derived from the CSV data, for internal data representation and manipulation.

## Constraints

- The application must operate as a single-page app, with no multi-page navigation.
- Development must adhere to the specified technologies: Svelte 5, SvelteKit 2, D3.js, topojson-client, and Tailwind v4.
- Data is restricted to the provided CSV file; no additional external data sources are to be used.

## Assumptions

- The CSV data is complete, with no missing or inconsistent values for the specified columns.
- Every county displayed on the map has corresponding data in the CSV file for all relevant years and cancer types.
- Users possess basic familiarity with web-based maps and filtering interfaces, requiring minimal onboarding.

## Commands

- **Development**: `bun run dev` - Starts dev server
- **Build**: `bun run build` - Builds production version
- **Lint**: `bun run lint` - Runs Prettier and ESLint
- **Format**: `bun run format` - Auto-formats code with Prettier
- **Type Check**: `bun run check` - Validates TypeScript types

## Code Style

- **Framework**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 runes and TypeScript
- **Formatting**: Prettier with tailwind plugin (2-space indent, single quotes)
- **CSS**: TailwindCSS for styling
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript, explicit type annotations for function params and returns
- **Imports**: Group imports: Svelte first, third-party libs next, local modules last
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch with specific error types, provide fallback UI

## Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase
- **Functions**: camelCase
- **Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: camelCase (not UPPER_CASE)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase, prefixed with type for type aliases

## Data Visualization

- Use D3.js for visualizations
- TopoJSON/GeoJSON for map data
- Maintain responsive SVG containers
- Properly type data structures and D3 selections
